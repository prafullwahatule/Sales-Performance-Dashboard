## 📊 Project Overview

**Project Name:** Sales Performance Dashboard  
**Client:** ShopEase LLC  
**Industry:** E-commerce & Retail  
**Duration:** 10 Months  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, SQL, Excel, DAX

ShopEase LLC is a growing e-commerce retail company that sells products across multiple regions. The management team faced challenges in tracking overall sales performance due to data scattered across multiple sources and lack of real-time insights.

The goal of this project was to design a centralized, executive-level Power BI dashboard that provides a clear and accurate view of sales, revenue growth, regional performance, and product trends, enabling leadership to make data-driven decisions.

## 🧩 Business Problem

Before this project, ShopEase LLC faced the following problems:

### 1. Sales data was fragmented

* Sales data existed in multiple systems (orders, customers, products, regions).
* No single source of truth for reporting.

### 2. Manual and time-consuming reporting

* Monthly and weekly sales reports were created manually using Excel.
* High risk of errors and delays in decision-making.

### 3. Limited visibility for leadership

Executives could not easily track:

* Revenue growth
* Regional sales performance
* Product-wise trends
* Underperforming regions or products

### 4. No advanced performance metrics

* Metrics like YoY growth, MoM trends, and Average Order Value (AOV) were not available.
* Difficult to compare current performance with previous periods.

### 5. Slow report performance

* Existing reports were slow due to poor data modeling and inefficient calculations.
